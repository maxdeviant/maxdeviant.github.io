title: The Great Migration, Pt. I
---


Having found myself in the possession of more free time than usual, I figured it would be an ideal time to redo my website for the umpteenth time. Following a rather lengthy hiatus from my now legacy site, I am back with new hosting.

After a long period of internal debate, I finally decided to switch over to GitHub Pages for my primary webhosting. I was previously running off of MediaTemple's Grid Hosting plan, but I found that I did not have much of a need for a full-blown host. While I did host a few things on it from time to time, the addition of my in-home server alleviated most of those needs. This left my server instance serving up nothing more than some abandoned static pages. No reason to be dropping $20/month on something GitHub offers for free.

The minor flaw with this switch would be the loss of my custom domain email address. While my primary Gmail address is not something completely idiotic (e.g. `420yoloblaze@gmail.com`), I do find it a bit too informal for work purposes. That being said, custom email addresses do not exactly remedy the issue either. Keeping track of multiple inboxes is a hassle, which has resulted in me configuring all of my other email to reroute through Gmail. This allows me to have all my emails in one place, as well as send emails as the other addresses.

While this setup works fairly well – aside from when my domain does not transfer properly and lose control of my email in the midst of waiting to hear back from potential employers – it is not a perfect solution. The ideal solution would have been for 14-year-old me to decide *not* to use an alias for my Gmail address in keeping with the interests for his professional future. Regrettably, I have to live with my younger self's questionable choices until time travel becomes a viable option.

This leaves me with one real option: **make a new Gmail address.**

I still cringe a little bit when I think about it. Given Google's prevalence in the digital world today and the countless integrations that a Google account has, changing Gmail addresses is no small feat. Even without the vast amounts of data inextricably tied to my Google account, there are still the countless websites and services that also know me by my Gmail address.

This poses a very large problem for the hopeful migrant. *How in the world am I supposed to switch to another Gmail address?*

It is to this very question that I posit the following answer: slowly.
